This challenge will be perfect practice for anyone wanting to test their CSS Grid skills. Grid is such a powerful addition to CSS, so it's worth getting to grips with it!

This practice helped me to know more about css grid and it's features. I have chose this practice because looked rrally interesting to me, I could create some media queries to make the page responsive to mobile devices and tablets. I really hope learn more about grid in the future and the correct aplication on this amazing  feature of CSS.
